I am @NULLLEECH
</h1>
</br>
<p>
I am <i>new</i> to programming, as in, i've been working on a large set of small to medium sized projects.
This account is my attempt of beginning to learn git and archive the good and bad code I produce as mock portfolio.
</p>
<p>
ANYWAYS...</br>
You can say hi to me at \<NULLLEACH@tuta.io\>.
Yes, that is wrong, I am dumb!
</p>
<p>
Happy programming.

# I am @NULLLEECH

I am <i>newish</i> to programming, as in, i've been working on a large set of small to medium sized projects.
This account is my attempt of beginning to learn git and archive the good and bad code I produce as mock portfolio.

You can say hi to me at NULLLEACH@tuta.io.

Yes, that is wrong, I am dumb!

Happy programming.
